## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` to start the server. The server runs on port 8080.
### `node view/view_all.js` to view all tables in the deployment_db database. This database runs in a Docker container.
### `node view/view_personnel.js` to view the personnel table in the deployment_db database. This database runs in a Docker container.
### `node view/view_medical.js` to view the medical table in the deployment_db database. This database runs in a Docker container.
### `node view/view_training.js` to view the training table in the deployment_db database. This database runs in a Docker container.
### `node view/view_training_type.js` to view the training type table in the deployment_db database. This database runs in a Docker container.

### `npx knex migrate:rollback` to remove all tables in the deployment_db database.
### `npx knex migrate:latest` to create the tables with the latest schema in the deployment_db database.
### `npx knex seed:run` to use the 'faker' module to plant randomly-generated data within each table in the deployment_db database.

In the project's 'app' directory, you can run:

### `npm start` to start the application. The application runs on port 3000.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
